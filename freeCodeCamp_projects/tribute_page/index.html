            <h3 class="text-center">Timeline of Cristiano Ronaldo's career</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span>5 feb 1985 -</span> Ronaldo was born in Santo António, a neighbourhood of Funchal, Madeira, the youngest
                    child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Aveiro, a cook, and José Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener. He was
                    named after Ronald Reagan, who was his father's favorite actor.</li> <br />
                <li><span>1 Jul 1993 -</span> At the age of eight, Ronaldo played for amateur team Andorinha, where his father
                    worked as the kit man. His father was the main one that influenced Ronaldo to start playing the sport
                    of soccer. Even at such young age, he began to show his massive talents on soccer and several scouters
                    from the other European teams get to notice him.</li> <br />
                <li><span>1 Jun 1995 -</span> Ronaldo signed with local club Nacional. The coach in the Nacional recognized Ronaldo's
                    great talent and decides to teach him in order to let him become a great player in the future. Here,
                    he learns the style of training from the coach, which is stopless and very hardcore. Experiencing the
                    hard training at the young age let him to easily have the habit of continuously training himself for
                    the improved skills.
                </li> <br />
                <li><span>1 Jun 1997 -</span> After playing well for Nacional, he went on a three-days trial with Sporting CP,
                    who subsequently signed him. The scouter of the Sporting recommended the youth coach to sign Ronaldo,
                    who seemed to have best talent on soccer that he have never seen before in his life. He played for the
                    youth teams from 1997 - 2001. He became the only player ever to play for Sporting's U-16, U-17, U-18,
                    B-team, and first team, all within one season.</li> <br />
                <li><span>1 Sep 2001 -</span> After playing well for the youth teams, Cristiano made the step up to the senior
                    team. This was when he was only 16 years old, which is about the age of high scholars. He wrote in his
                    autobiography that his first debut was very nervous for him as well as many other players and it was
                    his first time to experience the pressure in the stadium as the professional player. Between 2001 - 2003
                    he makes 25 appearances and scores 3 goals.</li> <br />
                <li><span>18 Jul 2003 -</span> In the May of 2003, Sporting Lisbon and Manchester United decide to have a friendly
                    match against each other. Ronaldo was selected to be on the starting line up against the United. After
                    Sporting beat United 3-1 in a pre-season friendly, United's players including Patrice Evra and Rio Ferdinand
                    urged Sir Alex Ferguson to sign Ronaldo. Not only the players but the Ferguson was also impressed at
                    Ronaldo's great tanet on dribbling and powerful shots. Eventually, he joined United for £12.24 million.</li>
                <br />
                <li><span>1 Jul 2006 -</span> During the quarter finals against England, Ronaldo's United teammate Wayne Rooney
                    was sent off. The English media speculated that Ronaldo had influenced referee Horacio Elizondo's decision
                    by aggressively complaining, after which he was seen in replays winking at the Portuguese bench following
                    Rooney's dismissal. The angry reaction from the English press caused Ronaldo to consider leaving United.
                    Later, he explained the exact situation and his feelings about the incident in his autobiography.</li>
                <br />
                <li><span>28 May 2008 -</span> Ronaldo scores a header and is voted man of the match as United beat Chelsea in
                    Moscow to win the Champions League. This was considered to be his best season at United. He scored 42
                    goals and won the Golden Boot award for the top goalscorer in Europe. He also won the Ballon d'Or award,
                    becoming the first United player since George Best in 1968 to do so. As a result, Ronaldo started to
                    be recognized as one of the best players in the world.</li> <br />
                <li><span>6 Jul 2009 -</span> At this time, Ronaldo thought that he has done everything in the United and it's
                    time for him to move to another team for new challenges. Coincidentally, Manchester United evnetually
                    accepted an unconditional offer of £80 million from Real Madrid for Ronaldo. He was presented to the
                    world media as a Real Madrid player on 6 July. He was welcomed by 80,000 fans at his presentation at
                    the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, which is the home stadium of Real Madrid.</li> <br />
                <li><span>29 Jun 2010 -</span> At this time, Ronaldo was in a great pace in Real Madrid. Hence, it was speculated
                    that Ronaldo will dominate the stage of World cup. However, Ronaldo failed to show the great performance
                    as an individual and his natioal team of Portugal also fails to proceed on from the second round. Ronaldo
                    had a disappointing World Cup, losing 1-0 to Spain, the team that eventually won the world cup, in the
                    second round.
                </li> <br />
                <li><span>21 Jun 2011 -</span> Although Ronaldo didn't do well in the world cup of 2010, he continued his stunning
                    plays in the field as part of Real Madrid. As a result, Ronaldo receives the La Liga Golden Shoe award,
                    which is given to the player who scored the most during the season in La Liga. He later donates this
                    Golden Boots in aid of children in Gaza, Palestine.</li> <br />
                <li><span>21 Jun 2012 -</span> Ronaldo donated his Golden Boot which he earned in 2011 to the auction. This was
                    sold in €1.5 million, and the Real Madrid Foundation used this money to build schools in Gaza, Palestaine.</li>
                <br />
                <li><span>13 Feb 2013 -</span> Real Madrid star forward Cristiano Ronaldo has donated 100,000 euro to the physical
                    rehabilitation programme of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Afghanistan.Not only
                    supporting their physical rehabilitation, but the ICRC also helps disabled people by financing education,
                    vocational training, employment and some small-business activities. For the programme in the Afghanistan,
                    it started since 2005 and still continues to help the disabled and the hungry children in the country.</li>
